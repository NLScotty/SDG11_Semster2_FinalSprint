To setup, follow the steps below.

1. Launch 2 terminal windows
2. On both terminals, switch into the shop-app directory
3. On one terminal, run 'npm run server'. This will run the database where the product information is fetched from.
4. On the other terminal, run 'npm start'. This will launch the application

To run our tests, run 'npm test' whilst the product server is running on another terminal
